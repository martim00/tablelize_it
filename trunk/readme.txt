Including only four files in your test project you can now use tableLise, they are.
Table.h
Fixture.h
TableParser.h
FixtureGlossary.h

TableLize was created with the intention 
of facilitating the creation of automated testing, 
where new cases can be added for testing quickly and easily.
Without the need to recompile the test project, 
as new cases are added in text files, so the implementation 
of new tests is dynamic and can be added a lot of tests with ease.
Even people without programming skills can edit the tables 
of parameters and help increase your battery of tests.
The project is in its early stages and is already in use. 
Several improvements are still needed and will be incorporated soon.

Examples in the folder have a very simple example which will help him in his early tests.
